  <h3>Can I Dropship from India to America? </h3>
  <div class="faq-content">
    <p>Yes, you can dropship from India to the America, but shipping times can be a concern. Use Indian platforms like GlowRoad, IndiaMART, or Baapstore, and make sure the supplier can provide international shipping with tracking. You’ll need to communicate clearly with your supplier about delivery timelines and choose ePacket or express courier services like FedEx or DHL for faster fulfillment. Keep in mind: longer shipping may affect customer satisfaction unless clearly communicated on your site.
