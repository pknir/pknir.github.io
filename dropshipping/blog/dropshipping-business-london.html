        <li><b>Ensuring GDPR compliance for customer data protection </b> </li>        
    </ul>
 </p>
 <p>While dropshipping itself is legal, misleading advertising, selling counterfeit products, or failing to deliver orders can lead to legal issues.

          "text": "No, Craftd London is not a dropshipping company. It is a premium jewelry brand that designs and sells its own high-quality jewelry. Unlike dropshipping businesses that source products from suppliers, Craftd London manages its own inventory and fulfillment. While some resellers may attempt to dropship similar jewelry, Craftd London does not offer dropshipping services. If you're looking to start a jewelry dropshipping business, consider print-on-demand jewelry suppliers or platforms like Spocket, Zendrop, or AliExpress."
